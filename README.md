What is the question you hope to answer?
  Option 1: Is there anything that makes a man or woman approach speed dating differently than the majority of other people of the same gender? 
  Option 2: Rank the importance of all the factors that make a country more tolerant toward homosexuality, from affluence, less religious, to others.
What data are you planning to use to answer that question?
  Option 1: https://www.kaggle.com/annavictoria/speed-dating-experiment/feed
  Option 2: http://www.pewglobal.org/2013/06/04/the-global-divide-on-homosexuality/
What do you know about the data you're using so far?
  Not much yet, but they both seem like large enough data sets to have fun with. 
Why did you choose this topic?
  Option 1: Dating is fascinating. 
  Option 2: I'm curious about which global factors make countries more or less tolerant and if they hold true in the US / smaller communities as well.
